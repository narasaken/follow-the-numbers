# follow-the-numbers
At the beginning of the game, ten dots appear at random positions on the screen, each with a number next to it. You need to click on the dots in the correct order to connect them. The game will finish once you’ve connected all the dots together. But if you make a mistake, all the lines will disappear and you’ll have to start from the very first dot again.
